# Audio Example

## Intro

This is a bit more complex example using the I2S PMOD board from Digilent. The unit will support two modes:
- Passthrough mode: Audio In => Audio Out
- Signal genenerator mode: Sinewave => Audio Out

The Passthrough amplitude will start at full output and decrease or incrase in 6dB steps.

The Signal generator mode output frequency will start at 1 KHz and go up to 20 KHz in 1 KHz steps. The amplitude will start at full output and decrease or increase in 6dB steps. 

Switch SW0 will determine mode: Passthrough or Signal Generator.
Buttons BTN0 (increase) and BTN1 (decrease) will determine amplitude.
Buttons BTN2 (increase) and BTN3 (decrease) will determine frequency.

An added complexity to this design is the use of two clocks. The master clock is generated by the onboard 100 MHz clock. An additional 12.288 MHz clock from a PLL is used to sample and clock audio data. That means we'll be working on two clock domains, so we'll have to deal with that explicitly.
