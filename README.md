# Non-Exhaustive Migen and Litex Introduction

## Intro

The purpose of this guide is to help understand a little about Migen, the Python based hardware programming language, and Litex, the framework to create SoCs (System On Chip) based on Migen. I'm still finding it a bit difficult to understand all concepts, and sometimes the documentation is a bit scarce. Also, this serves me as a memory guide, I'm sure I'll forget most of this by the time it's finished.

I'm separating the different sections in chapters, and will try to update them regularly, basically the more I understand something the easier it should be to explain.

Make sure you install Litex and Migen as specified in the quickstart guide, as this is not covered in here.

## Further Information

Still, there's tons of information around to start with, some of them are:
- [Litex](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex) Quickstart and install guides
- [Litex Hub](https://github.com/litex-hub) Some good examples and board packages
- [Discord Litex Channel](https://discord.gg/PkJwjDbxeG)
- [Migen Litex Tutorial](https://github.com/fjullien/migen_litex_tutorials) This excellent tutorial covers a lot, it's a very good read!
- [openFPGALoader](https://trabucayre.github.io/openFPGALoader/guide/first-steps.html) openFPGALoader seems to be a good alternative for loading and flashing boards if openOCD fails.
